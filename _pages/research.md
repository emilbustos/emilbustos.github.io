## The Effect of Centrally Bargained Wages on Firm Growth ## 
[PDF](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hnmptmy0o3vwqvz/bustos_cbw_main.pdf?dl=0)

I study how firms adapt to exogenous changes in labor costs. To identify this effect, I exploit that industries in Sweden have a centrally bargained minimum increase in average wages each year. Since these are bargained on the industry-level, they are detached from the growth prospects of individual firms. Data on centralized wage increases for the years from 2001 to 2006 are combined with administrative panel data on firms. I then compare the growth rates of firms in related industries that face different centralized wage increases, while controlling for differences in growth trends. Higher centralized wage increases cause the average firm to increase sales and employment growth. These effects come from increased investments and hiring. In addition, firms increase their share of skilled labor. Moreover, the effects on employment are larger for large firms. This suggests that higher centralized wage increases also cause a reallocation of labor. These results are consistent with frictions and imperfect competition in the labor market.

## Financial Constraints and Insurance Demand in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises ## 
(with [Oliver Engist](https://sites.google.com/view/oliverengist/home), [Gustav Martinsson](https://www.kth.se/profile/gusma) and [Christian Thomann](https://www.kth.se/profile/thomann))

We study the impact of financing constraints on small and medium firms' risk management through insurance using a panel data on 16,000 firms from a large insurance company. We measure financing constraints using credit scores commonly used by banks and other lenders. We combine this data with administrative data on firms. We find that financially constrained firms purchase more insurance. This result is robust even when using other measures of financing constraints. Smaller firms purchase more insurance at the intensive margin. A regression-discontinuity design that isolates financing constraints from other confounding variables supports that financing constraints influence firm's demand for insurance.  

## The Effect of Financial Constraints on Inventory Holdings ##

Standard Finance theory predicts that more financially constrained firms hold larger inventories. I test this prediction using Swedish administrative data and data on credit scores. For identification, I exploit a discontinuity in the translation from continuous to discrete credit scores among Swedish firms. Firms that have a better credit score hold more inventories, both in the cross-section and around the cutoff. However, the regression discontinuity estimate is zero once we scale inventories by assets or sales. This suggests that inventories are determined by operational concerns rather than by financial concerns.
