I study how firms adapt to exogenous changes in labor costs induced by collective bargaining agreements. I use data on collective bargaining agreements in Sweden and study the impact of the nationwide bargaining that took place in 2004. I make a difference-in-differences analysis and compare firms in the same industry that have a different initial skill composition of their workers and thus face different bargained wage increases. Higher centralized wage increases cause the average firm to increase average wages (1.3\%) and to grow faster (2.7\%) both in terms of employment and sales, while profitability decreases. Firms increase both investments and substitute low-skilled for high-skilled labor. Moreover, the effects are more pronounced for firms with more labor market power and easier access to external finance. This suggests that the results are affected by labor market power, and the ease of input factor substitution.

## Financial Constraints and Insurance Demand in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises ##

We study the impact of financing constraints on corporate risk management. Using data on credit scores matched with unique information on firm level commercial insurance purchases, we find that financing constraints lead to higher insurance spending. We adopt a regression discontinuity design and show that financially constrained firms spend 5--14\% more on insurance than otherwise similar unconstrained firms. Our findings add new insights to the longstanding empirical puzzle whether financially constrained firms engage more in risk management. Furthermore, our results, shed light on risk management in smaller, mostly private firms.

The literature on recovery and creative destruction has analyzed the effects of large events like natural hazards or financial crises. However, large shocks induce significant general equilibrium effects that influence the recovery process of each individual firm. We complement the literature by studying how firms adjust to idiosyncratic shocks in an economy that is in equilibrium. We use a unique data set on the insurance purchases and insurance claims of 45,000 Swedish firms. Because insurance claims are unexpected and exogenous to productivity, we can identify the effect of shocks to physical assets. We find that firms, that experience a shock that leads to an insurance claim, quickly re-invest in their physical assets. Over a one-year time horizon this is accompanied by a temporary slowdown of the employment growth and a 50\% reduction in output growth. This effect is driven almost exclusively by firms with worse access to credit, whereas firms with the highest credit score experience no reduction in growth.

Standard finance theory predicts that more financially constrained firms hold larger inventories. I test this prediction using Swedish administrative data and data on credit scores. For identification, I exploit a discontinuity in the translation from continuous to discrete credit scores among Swedish firms. Firms that have a better credit score hold more inventories, both in the cross-section and around the cutoff. However, the regression discontinuity estimate is zero once we scale inventories by assets or sales. This suggests that inventories are determined by operational concerns rather than by financial concerns.

Many of the consequential risks individuals or firms face have very low probabilities of occurring. It is therefore difficult to accurately judge the risks one is exposed to from experience alone. This leads agents to resort to simple heuristics, such as weighting recent experiences more heavily when assessing risk. Using a unique data set on insurance purchases and insurance claims of 40,000 Swedish firms, we analyze how firms react when a similar firm in their municipality experiences a damage to their property. Our results suggest that firms do not adjust their insurance when other firms have a loss. Moreover, highly salient events do not create significant insurance demand either. This stands in contrast to previous studies, which find that agents increase their insurance after observing natural hazards. Our results are consistent with a theory where firms adequately judge their risk exposure and purchase insurance accordingly.
