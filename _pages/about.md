I am a fifth-year PhD student at the Department of Economics at the Stockholm School of Economics. 

My research interests are in labor economics, empirical corporate finance and applied microeconomics. 

I study the factors that enable or hinder firms to grow. In particular, I focus on the role of collective bargaining agreements, bank finance and commercial insurance.
