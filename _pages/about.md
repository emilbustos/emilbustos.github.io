I am a tenure-track economist at the [Research Institute of Industrial Economics](https://www.ifn.se/en/researchers/ifn-researcher/emil-bustos/) (Institute för näringslivsforskning, IFN). I got my PhD at the Department of Economics at the Stockholm School of Economics in 2022. 

My research interests are in labor economics, empirical corporate finance, and applied microeconomics. 

I study the factors that enable or hinder firms to grow. In particular, I focus on the role of collective bargaining agreements, bank finance, and commercial insurance.
